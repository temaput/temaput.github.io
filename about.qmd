I am a Senior Software Engineer and the Head of the Georgian Branch of Conso4s LTD. With over 10 years of experience in software development, I bring a wealth of technical knowledge and expertise to the table. 

I am proud of my recent accomplishments, including becoming a team lead after just half a year as a front-end engineer and receiving a partnership offer from one of my clients. I am also proud of the recent project I managed as the head of the Georgian Branch of Conso4s LTD, which I successfully architected and developed with the help of my team.

Looking ahead, I am eager to continue developing my skills in software development and architecture. I am also highly interested in AI and would be excited to participate in AI-focused projects. I hold a degree in musicology from the Gnesins Music Academy in Moscow and have a passion for classical music, cultorology and mathematics. In my free time, I enjoy playing chess and sometimes piano.

I lived in Georgia for 5 years. I was lucky enough to call Tbilisi my home. It's where I met my best friends and my wonderful wife. I will always be grateful for those special times.

Now, I live in Buenos Aires and I'm so happy here. The city is beautiful and the people are friendly. I want to know more about Argentina, so I'm learning Spanish. I hope to understand its culture and nature better.
